You'll need to change the AWS credentials in `config.template` and rename it to `config` , and change the disk image from the one I'm using (a custom-generated Starcluster-compatible Ubuntu 15.04 image; ask me if you want to use it, but I recommend using a standard image if you can) to something else. Other than that, fingers crossed, everything should work for you ... there's the possibility that the plugins may fail due to you not having some software installed that they expect (just because you're using a different disk image/ version of Ubuntu), so be aware you may need to monitor that and change the plugins accordingly, but those should be easy changes.
